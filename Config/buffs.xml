	<!--reverse skill notes Config variables	
				Skill notes and Nerd outfit are reversed.
				What this means is that in game code:
					each point in a perk increases the chance of getting that perk's skill Book
					the Nerd Outfit level (1-6) increases the chance of getting a free skill point when reading one of the perk's skill Book
				In Reverse skill Notes:
					each point in a perk increases the chance of getting a free skill book point when reading one of the the perk's skill book
					the Nerd Outfit level (1-6) increases the chance of getting skill books (any skill book - so more chance of getting skill Books
						instead of empty bookshelves or bits of paper)
			-->
			<!--There are 2 values for each perk Level: 
				ReverseSkillLevel1Chance is the percentage chance to get a skill book point when reading a book for the perk level.(1st level in this example)
				ReverseSkillLevel1Guaranteed (**MAX IS 5**) is the guaranteed skill book point received when reading a book for the perk level (1st level in this example)
				The above is in addition to the default basic skill point received.
				So for a perk level 5: if you want to have the player receive 2 skill points plus a 40% chance at a third skill book point (2.4)
				ReverseSkillLevel5Chance==40   this is a percentage
				ReverseSkillLevel5Guaranteed==2  this is a fixed integer amount **MAX IS 5**-->
			<!--note that some perks are less than 5 levels e.g. armour is 4 levels, for such perks the 3rd level is ignored
				so for armour the code uses 
					ReverseSkillLevel1Chance, ReverseSkillLevel2Chance, ReverseSkillLevel4Chance, ReverseSkillLevel5Chance AND
					ReverseSkillLevel1Guaranteed, ReverseSkillLevel2Guaranteed, ReverseSkillLevel4Guaranteed, ReverseSkillLevel5Guaranteed-->
			<!--the percentage chance to get a free skill book point per perk level when reading a skill book-->
